## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a portfolio site that highlights the skills and projects I'll be working on in GA. I will use HTML and CSS to style and format the site. I will use JavaScript to tackle interactions such as an image slider, a responsive hamburger menu, and quotes that fade in and out on a timer.


## Google Sheet

Include link to your google sheet here.  Here is the sample [Suresh had used in class](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1M3Eq1NXH2PNmeTlVviRhEjX9kenq769Vo2P5mMtro/edit#gid=0) 


## Wireframes

Below are links to wireframes that show the site blueprint for three different display sizes.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

Here is a full list of features that have been [prioritized](https://res.cloudinary.com/dssciwyew/image/upload/v1594484749/Time%20Matrix.png) based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.   

Based on the matrix data it will take me about 13 hours to complete the project.


### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. The MVP list includes functionality that will be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

- Create and setup HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Create CSS GRID containers to create a multi-column layout
- Create CSS flex-box containers
- Add images, icons, and content
- Create responsive design
- Create hamburger menu icon
- Pull in projects via API call from google sheet
- Deploy online via Github Pages

#### PostMVP 

- Add additional project links
- Add social media icons/links


## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections, the logic is broken down further into functional components.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Sections and grid| H | 2hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Sections and flex| H | 2hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Regular Nav | H | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Responsive | H | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Hamburger | H | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Working with API | H | 2hrs| -hr | -hr |
| Adding Form | H | 1hr| -hr | -hr |
| Total | H | 11hrs| -hrs | -hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Other sections and flex| M | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Social Media Icons | L | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
