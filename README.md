## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a portfolio site that highlights the skills and projects I'll be working on in GA. I will use HTML and CSS to style and format the site. I will use JavaScript to tackle interactions such as an image slider, a responsive hamburger menu, and quotes that fade in and out on a timer.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

Here is a full list of features that have been [prioritized](https://res.cloudinary.com/dssciwyew/image/upload/v1594484749/Time%20Matrix.png) based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.   

Based on the matrix data it will take about 16 hours to complete the project.


### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. The MVP list includes functionality that will be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP

- Create and setup HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Create CSS GRID containers to create a multi-column layout
- Create CSS flex-box containers
- Add images, icons, and content
- Create responsive design
- Create hamburger menu icon
- Pull in projects via API call from google sheet
- Deploy online via Github Pages

#### PostMVP 

- Add additional project links
- Add social media icons/links
